NOTE: The program recognizes the cards in exactly the same as specified above.

After loading the program into the SWI-Prolog and compiling:

- You may type in “showcards.” to see all the available cards in the game
  (“start” will also do this once the number and names of players are entered)

- Enter “start.” to start the program

- Input all the requested information:
   - The number of players must be between 2 and 6 (2 and 6 inclusive)
   - Name of the players can be any name (e.g. numbers 1-6; or one,two,three and so on)
   - Enter your player name (e.g. 1; one; two; ben)
   - All the valid cards will also be printed with their types for reference.
   - Enter the card(s) you have in hand (e.g. scarlet; plum; patio)
   - Enter “yes.” if you have any other card(s); otherwise enter “no.”

When finished entering the cards, the program will be initialized with the provided information.
And it will start to specify whose turn is now. If it’s your turn, it will make a possible suggestion.

After making suggestion, it will also ask if the other players skip or show any card(s) to disprove your suggestion.
In case somebody shows a card, it will store that information into the database.

If it’s other players’ turn, the program will ask if they make a suggestion or an accusation. In either case, it will request to enter the suggested or accused card.

When the program reaches a point that there is sufficient evidence to deduce the details of the murder, it will tell you to make an accusation instead.
